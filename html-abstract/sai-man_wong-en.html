  <h2>An Evaluation of Software-Based Traffic Generators using Docker</h2>

  <h4>Abstract</h4>
  <p style="line-height: 1.5">
  The Information and Communication Technology (ICT) industry
  and network researchers use traffic generator tools
  to a large extent to test their systems. The industry uses
  reliable and rigid hardware-based platform tools for highperformance
  network testing. The research community commonly
  uses software-based tools in, for example, experiments
  because of economic and flexibility aspects. As a
  result, it is possible to run these tools on different systems
  and hardware. In this thesis, we examine the software
  traffic generators Iperf, Mausezahn, Ostinato in a
  closed loop physical and virtual environment to evaluate
  the applicability of the tools and find sources of inaccuracy
  for a given traffic profile. For each network tool, we measure
  the throughput from 64- to 4096-byte in packet sizes.
  Also, we encapsulate each tool with container technology
  using Docker to reach a more reproducible and portable research.
  Our results show that the CPU primarily limits the
  throughput for small packet sizes, and saturates the 1000
  Mbps link for larger packet sizes. Finally, we suggest using
  these tools for simpler and automated network tests.
